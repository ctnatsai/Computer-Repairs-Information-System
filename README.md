# Computer-Repairs-Information-System
This Computer Repairs Management Information System works as an online web application that is hosted privately on the Rhodes University domain and so, it is not accessible publicly from the internet. The front end makes use of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The backend database is supported by Caspio Cloud database for students. The landing page is Entry.html and user can navigate to any part of the website from there. We are working collaboratively as a team of four students to build this application and I am responsible for the front end architecture and design.
